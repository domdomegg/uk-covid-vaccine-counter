# ðŸ’‰ UK COVID Vaccine Counter [(view live)](https://domdomegg.github.io/uk-covid-vaccine-counter/)

![Screenshot of vaccine counts](screenshot.png)

Attempts to estimate the live number of vaccines administered in the UK, based on the latest data from the [coronavirus.data.gov.uk API](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).

Estimates should be taken with a grain of salt as they're unlikely to be very accurate. Mainly just a bit of fun to give us hope that soon COVID will be a thing of the past.
